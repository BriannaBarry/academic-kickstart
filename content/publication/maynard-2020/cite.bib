 abstract = {Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signals through its cognate receptor tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) to promote the function of several classes of inhibitory interneurons. We previously reported that loss of BDNF-TrkB signaling in cortistatin (Cort)-expressing interneurons leads to behavioral hyperactivity and spontaneous seizures in mice. We performed bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) from the cortex of mice with disruption of BDNF-TrkB signaling in cortistatin interneurons, and identified differential expression of genes important for excitatory neuron function. Using translating ribosome affinity purification and RNA-seq, we define a molecular profile for Cort-expressing inhibitory neurons and subsequently compare the translatome of normal and TrkB-depleted Cort neurons, revealing alterations in calcium signaling and axon development. Several of the genes enriched in Cort neurons and differentially expressed in TrkB-depleted neurons are also implicated in autism and epilepsy. Our findings highlight TrkB-dependent molecular pathways as critical for the maturation of inhibitory interneurons and support the hypothesis that loss of BDNF signaling in Cort interneurons leads to altered excitatory/inhibitory balance.
