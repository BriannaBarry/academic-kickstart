Welcome! My name is Brianna Barry, and I'm a Neuroscience PhD candidate at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. My thesis advisors are [Andrew Jaffe](http://aejaffe.com) and [Keri Martinowich](http://neuroscience.jhu.edu/research/faculty/56), whose labs are housed in the [Lieber Institute for Brain Development](https://libd.org). I'm currently working on classifying the shared and unique neural molecular configurations of neuropsychiatric disorders. Of course, researchers are notorious moonlighters, and my broader interests include  science communication, programming, data analysis, Linux, and free and open science. Check out my contact and social media information to get in touch!
