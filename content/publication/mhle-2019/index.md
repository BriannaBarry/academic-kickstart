abstract: "OBJECTIVE: Alcohol use disorders inflict a great individual and societal burden. Although sex hormone effects have been implicated in alcohol dependence, research has mostly neglected estrogen activities and female alcohol-dependent patients. Here, we investigated associations of estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) genetics and serum estradiol activities with aspects of alcohol dependence. METHOD: Serum estradiol activities of early-abstinent alcohol-dependent in-patients (n[♂] = 113, n[♀] = 87) were followed for at median 5 days and compared with healthy controls (n[♂] = 133, n[♀] = 107). All participants were genotyped for five ESR1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs6902771, rs11155819, rs6557171, rs2982683, rs2982712). RESULTS: Bioavailable estradiol levels decreased during withdrawal treatment (P[♂] textless  0.001, P[♀] = 0.011). Male patients with an increase of bioavailable estradiol during withdrawal showed fewer days to (P = .033) and more alcohol-related readmissions (P textless  .05) during the 12-month follow-up. Higher estradiol and estradiol-to-testosterone activities were significantly related to liver, muscle, and cell count damage in male patients. Estradiol-to-testosterone activities in female patients were lower compared to female controls (total P = .013, bioavailable P = .009). Moreover, the ESR1 genotypes jointly separated alcohol-dependent patients from controls (P = .037). CONCLUSION: Our findings support the role of ESR1 genetics in alcohol dependence and show for the first time that estradiol activities may sex-specifically predict alcohol-related sequelae and outcome following in-patient withdrawal treatment.
